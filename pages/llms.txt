# Replay Buffer Pro

> OBS Studio plugin for saving replay buffer clips at multiple customizable durations without re-encoding

## Overview

Replay Buffer Pro is a free, open-source plugin for OBS Studio that expands upon the built-in Replay Buffer functionality. It allows content creators, streamers, and gamers to save recent footage at multiple customizable durations with a single click or hotkey press, similar to PlayStation and Xbox's "Save Recent Gameplay" feature.

**Key Value Proposition**: Save clips at different lengths from the same replay buffer without re-encoding, making it perfect for creating content for various platforms (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, etc.).

## Technical Specifications

- **Type**: OBS Studio Dock Plugin
- **Platform**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit), Linux (x86_64), macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- **Requirements**: OBS Studio 30.0.0+
- **Programming Language**: C++ with Qt6
- **Video Processing**: libavformat with stream copy (no re-encoding)
- **License**: GPL v2 or later (Open Source)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/JoshuaPotter/replay-buffer-pro
- **Documentation**: https://joshuapotter.github.io/replay-buffer-pro/

## Key Features

1. **Custom Save Buttons**: Save any custom clip length instantly with fully customizable save buttons
2. **No Re-encoding**: Uses libavformat with stream copy for fast, lossless output
3. **Hotkey Support**: Assign hotkeys for each save button in OBS settings
4. **Adjustable Buffer Length**: Set replay buffer from 1 second to 6 hours via slider
5. **Dockable UI**: Minimal, clean interface that docks in OBS Studio
6. **Automatic Trimming**: Saves full buffer then trims to desired length automatically

## Use Cases

- **Streaming & Content Creation**: Twitch and YouTube streamers capture highlight moments for social media clips
- **Sports & Esports Analysis**: Coaches save gameplay segments for review without post-processing delays
- **Tutorial & Educational Content**: Educators capture recording segments at various lengths for different platforms
- **Software Development & QA**: Developers save bug reproductions and feature demonstrations instantly

## Installation

### Windows (Quick Install)

1. Download the latest release from: https://github.com/JoshuaPotter/replay-buffer-pro/releases/latest
2. Close OBS Studio completely
3. Extract the ZIP file
4. Merge the `obs-studio` folder into your OBS Studio installation directory (typically `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\`)
5. Verify installation:
   - DLL location: `obs-studio/obs-plugins/64bit/replay-buffer-pro.dll`
   - Data location: `obs-studio/data/obs-plugins/replay-buffer-pro/` (includes locale files)
6. Open OBS Studio

**Note**: Administrator privileges may be required to copy files to Program Files.

### Linux / macOS (Build from Source)

See the full build instructions in the README: https://github.com/JoshuaPotter/replay-buffer-pro#building-from-source

Quick summary:
1. Install dependencies: Qt6, FFmpeg dev libraries, CMake 3.16+, OBS Studio 30.0.0+ (with CMake package config)
2. Clone and build the plugin:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/joshuapotter/replay-buffer-pro.git
   cd replay-buffer-pro
   cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt6
   cmake --build build
   cmake --install build
   ```
3. Open OBS Studio

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. Open OBS Studio
2. Show the Replay Buffer Pro dock: **Docks → Replay Buffer Pro**
3. Adjust the Replay Buffer length using the slider (optional)
4. Start the Replay Buffer from OBS
5. Click a save button (e.g., "Last 30 Seconds") or trigger its hotkey to save a clip

### Setting Up Hotkeys

1. Go to **OBS Studio Settings → Hotkeys**
2. Search for "Replay Buffer Pro"
3. Assign keys for each save button duration
4. Click OK to save

### Important Notes

- Clips save to the same OBS recordings folder set in Output settings
- Save buttons are disabled if the buffer length is shorter than the clip length
- Buffer length cannot be changed while Replay Buffer is active (stop it first)
- No re-encoding means clips maintain the same quality as your buffer

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from OBS's default Replay Buffer?**
A: The default saves a single fixed duration clip. Replay Buffer Pro lets you save multiple customizable lengths on demand with buttons/hotkeys, and trims automatically.

**Q: Does it re-encode video?**
A: No. Trimming uses FFmpeg with `-c copy` for fast, lossless output.

**Q: Why are some save buttons disabled?**
A: Your configured buffer length is shorter than that clip length. Increase the buffer length or choose a shorter clip.

**Q: Can I customize the save button durations?**
A: Yes. Use the Customize button in the Save Clips section to set each button's duration.

**Q: Where are clips saved?**
A: In your OBS Studio Replay Buffer save directory (set in OBS Studio Output settings).

**Q: What platforms are supported?**
A: Windows 10/11 (64-bit), Linux (x86_64), and macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon). Windows has a pre-built release download; Linux and macOS require building from source.

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin Not Loading**
- Windows: ensure `replay-buffer-pro.dll` is in `obs-studio/obs-plugins/64bit/`
- Linux/macOS: ensure the plugin `.so` is in the correct OBS plugins directory
- Restart OBS Studio after placing the file
- Check OBS logs for "Replay Buffer Pro" entries

**Trimming Fails**
- Confirm locale files exist at `obs-studio/data/obs-plugins/replay-buffer-pro/locale/`
- Check disk space availability
- Verify write permissions in output directory

**Button Disabled**
- Check if your buffer length is long enough for that clip duration
- Ensure Replay Buffer is started in OBS

## Building from Source

### Requirements (all platforms)
- CMake 3.16+
- Qt6 (Widgets + Core)
- FFmpeg (libavformat, libavcodec, libavutil)
- OBS Studio 30.0.0+ (source checkout on Windows; CMake package config install on Linux/macOS)

### Windows
- Visual Studio 2022+ with C++ Desktop Development
- Qt6 MSVC 2022 64-bit

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshuapotter/replay-buffer-pro.git
cd replay-buffer-pro
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/Qt/6.8.2/msvc2022_64" ..
cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo
cmake --install . --config RelWithDebInfo
```

**Note**: Ensure `obs-studio` repository is located as a sibling directory. Install command requires elevated privileges.

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt install cmake gcc g++ qt6-base-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev
git clone https://github.com/joshuapotter/replay-buffer-pro.git
cd replay-buffer-pro
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build
```

### macOS
```bash
brew install cmake qt6 ffmpeg
git clone https://github.com/joshuapotter/replay-buffer-pro.git
cd replay-buffer-pro
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix qt6)"
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

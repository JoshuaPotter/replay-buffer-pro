# Replay Buffer Pro

> OBS Studio plugin for saving replay buffer clips at multiple preset durations without re-encoding

## Overview

Replay Buffer Pro is a free, open-source plugin for OBS Studio that expands upon the built-in Replay Buffer functionality. It allows content creators, streamers, and gamers to save recent footage at multiple preset durations (15 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes) with a single click or hotkey press, similar to PlayStation and Xbox's "Save Recent Gameplay" feature.

**Key Value Proposition**: Save clips at different lengths from the same replay buffer without re-encoding, making it perfect for creating content for various platforms (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, etc.).

## Technical Specifications

- **Type**: OBS Studio Dock Plugin
- **Platform**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit only)
- **Requirements**: OBS Studio 30.0.0+
- **Programming Language**: C++ with Qt6
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg with stream copy (no re-encoding)
- **License**: GPL v2 or later (Open Source)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/JoshuaPotter/replay-buffer-pro
- **Documentation**: https://joshuapotter.github.io/replay-buffer-pro/

## Key Features

1. **Quick-Save Presets**: Save the last 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, 15m, or 30m instantly
2. **No Re-encoding**: Uses FFmpeg with `-c copy` for fast, lossless output
3. **Hotkey Support**: Assign hotkeys for each preset length in OBS settings
4. **Adjustable Buffer Length**: Set replay buffer from 1 second to 6 hours via slider
5. **Dockable UI**: Minimal, clean interface that docks in OBS Studio
6. **Automatic Trimming**: Saves full buffer then trims to desired length automatically

## Use Cases

- **Streaming & Content Creation**: Twitch and YouTube streamers capture highlight moments for social media clips
- **Sports & Esports Analysis**: Coaches save gameplay segments for review without post-processing delays
- **Tutorial & Educational Content**: Educators capture recording segments at various lengths for different platforms
- **Software Development & QA**: Developers save bug reproductions and feature demonstrations instantly

## Installation

### Quick Install (Windows)

1. Download the latest release from: https://github.com/JoshuaPotter/replay-buffer-pro/releases/latest/download/replay-buffer-pro-windows-x64.zip
2. Close OBS Studio completely
3. Extract the ZIP file
4. Merge the `obs-studio` folder into your OBS Studio installation directory (typically `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\`)
5. Verify installation:
   - DLL location: `obs-studio/obs-plugins/64bit/replay-buffer-pro.dll`
   - Data location: `obs-studio/data/obs-plugins/replay-buffer-pro/` (includes ffmpeg.exe and locale files)
6. Open OBS Studio

**Note**: Administrator privileges may be required to copy files to Program Files.

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. Open OBS Studio
2. Show the Replay Buffer Pro dock: **Docks → Replay Buffer Pro**
3. Adjust the Replay Buffer length using the slider (optional)
4. Start the Replay Buffer from OBS
5. Click a save button (e.g., "Last 30 Seconds") or trigger its hotkey to save a clip

### Setting Up Hotkeys

1. Go to **OBS Studio Settings → Hotkeys**
2. Search for "Replay Buffer Pro"
3. Assign keys for each duration preset
4. Click OK to save

### Important Notes

- Clips save to the same OBS recordings folder set in Output settings
- Save buttons are disabled if the buffer length is shorter than the clip length
- Buffer length cannot be changed while Replay Buffer is active (stop it first)
- No re-encoding means clips maintain the same quality as your buffer

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from OBS's default Replay Buffer?**
A: The default saves a single fixed duration clip. Replay Buffer Pro lets you save multiple preset lengths on demand with buttons/hotkeys, and trims automatically.

**Q: Does it re-encode video?**
A: No. Trimming uses FFmpeg with `-c copy` for fast, lossless output.

**Q: Why are some save buttons disabled?**
A: Your configured buffer length is shorter than that clip length. Increase the buffer length or choose a shorter clip.

**Q: Can I change the preset durations?**
A: Not currently. The UI provides fixed presets: 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, 15m, and 30m.

**Q: Where are clips saved?**
A: In your OBS Studio Replay Buffer save directory (set in OBS Studio Output settings).

**Q: What platforms are supported?**
A: Currently Windows 10/11 (64-bit) only. macOS and Linux support is planned for future releases.

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin Not Loading**
- Ensure `replay-buffer-pro.dll` is in `obs-studio/obs-plugins/64bit/`
- Restart OBS Studio after placing the file
- Check OBS logs for "Replay Buffer Pro" entries

**Trimming Fails**
- Confirm `ffmpeg.exe` exists at `obs-studio/data/obs-plugins/replay-buffer-pro/`
- Check disk space availability
- Verify write permissions in output directory

**Button Disabled**
- Check if your buffer length is long enough for that clip duration
- Ensure Replay Buffer is started in OBS
